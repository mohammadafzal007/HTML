<p><b>April is the fourth month in the Gregorian calendar and has 30 days. It is the second month of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the second month of astronomical fall in the Southern Hemisphere.
On April 1, people in countries all over the world like to play pranks on other people. Depending on the culture, the victim of such a joke is known as a fool or a fish (poisson dâ€™avril). It is not clear when the tradition started, and there are countless theories.
The likely answer why we play hoaxes on each other in April is because the winter is over: March and April end the long time of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and bring new life. In many cultures, this was celebrated with colorful festivities, dancing, and making fun of each other.
