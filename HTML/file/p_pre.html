     <P>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation 
          (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually
           by designing/building an executable computer program. Programming 
           involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
            algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation 
            of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1</P>
