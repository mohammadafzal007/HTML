    <P >Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
        run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
        similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

    <p >Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help
        programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.[29]
        
        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
        "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30][31]
        
        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and
        first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such
        as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0,
        released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
        2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]</p>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank" ><img src="C.png" alt="logo of C" title="Logo of C" width="300" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a>
    <p >C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting
        structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides
        constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications
        previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application
        software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

        A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between
        1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
        operating system.[7] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used
        programming languages,[8][9] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing
        computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the
        International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" ><img src="C++.jpg" alt="logo of C++" title="Logo of C" width="300" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN="left" hspace="5" vspace="30"></a>
        <p >C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of
            the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern
            C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory
            manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers,
            including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many
            platforms.[10]
    
            C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and
            large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11] C++ has also
            been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
            resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce,
            web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[12]</p>
